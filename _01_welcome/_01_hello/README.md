Welcome to a tour of the Go programming language.

The tour is divided into a list of modules that you can
access by clicking on
<a style="cursor: pointer" onclick="highlight('[title=tour]')">tour</a> on the top left of the page, or by clicking the lessons in the menu below.

Throughout the tour you will find a series of slides and exercises for you
to complete.

The tour is interactive. Click the
<a style="cursor: pointer" onclick="highlightAndClick('#runButton')">Run</a> button now
(or press `Command` + `Enter`) to compile and run the program in your web browser.

The result is displayed below the code.

These example programs demonstrate different aspects of Go. The programs in the tour are meant to be starting points for your own experimentation.

Edit the program and run it again.

When you're ready to move on, click the next lesson below.
