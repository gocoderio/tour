* The Go Playground &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="_01_welcome/_02_webassembly"></span>

This tour is built atop the web assembly, it runs inside your web browser so your code stays private.

There are limitations to the programs that can be run in a web browser:

- In the playground the time is accurate if your computer time is accurate.

- There are no limits on execution time or CPU and memory usage, except for your hardware limits. The program can access external network hosts.

- Networking and Cross Origin API calls have been tested, but limited to what browser security allows.

The is web assembly playground uses the latest stable release of Go.
